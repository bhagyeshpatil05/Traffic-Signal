🚦 Intelligent Traffic Signal Control System (AI)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements an Artificial Intelligence–based Intelligent Traffic Signal Control System that dynamically manages traffic signals based on traffic density. Unlike traditional fixed-time signal systems, this AI-driven approach adapts signal decisions to reduce congestion and waiting time.

🎯 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion is a major issue caused by inefficient traffic signal control. Fixed signal timings fail to respond to real-time traffic conditions. This project aims to design an intelligent system that optimizes signal control using AI techniques.

🧠 AI Concepts Used

Intelligent Agent

State Space Representation

Heuristic Search (Greedy Best First Search)

Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)

⚙️ Methodology

Traffic density is taken as user input for four roads (North, East, South, West)

Traffic conditions are represented as states

The road with the highest traffic density is prioritized

Constraints ensure valid traffic states

The system runs for a fixed number of signal cycles to ensure finite execution

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

📊 Output

Dynamic selection of green signal

Gradual reduction of traffic congestion

📌 Applications

Smart traffic management systems

Smart city solutions

Emergency traffic prioritization (future scope)

Valid and constraint-free signal operations

Finite execution with predefined cycles
